# Simple product options for Silvershop
User can create a simple options called something like "Size", and add values to it like XL, L, S, etc. These can then be chosen in the frontend, on products, and will be shown in cart etc.

Each value can also have a price defined which gets added on top of the product price.


This module was inspired by Magento's product options functionality

### Why not variations ###
Its much easier to create these instead of variations (UI wise). Variations have their place, but might be too complex for **some** clients.

### IMPORTANT ###
This form of variations on a product does require the shop owner to handle any combination of options that actually dont exist in real life.

You can not use both Variations and simple options at the same time, on a product

## ANOTHER IMPORTANT ###
This modul was created a bit fast and might not be completely stable. Use at own risk pls
